# Synchronize secrets with your PC #

If you've ever wanted to access your secrets on your PC, give Chris Wood's _**PCSecrets**_ a try.  You'll need the following:

  1. _**PCSecrets**_ running on the PC.  Get it from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsecrets/files/?source=navbar).
  1. _**PCSSync**_, a companion android app that keeps your secrets on the phone in sync with the PC.  Get it directly from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceperman.sync).

Chris and I worked closely together to make sync as easy and secure as possible.  Let us know what you think on the [discuss forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/secrets-for-android).

## Transfer Secrets to a New Phone ##

PCSecrets is also a good way to transfer secrets to a new phone.  First make sure to keep your existing phone in sync with your PC.  When you get a new phone, install _**Secrets for Android**_ and _**PCSSync**_, and sync.  You're done!
